    <li><strong>00 pasta flour 500g, plus extra for dusting</li>
      <li>fine sea salt a pinch</li>
      <li>eggs 4 large</li>
      <li>egg yolks 2</li>
      <li>LAMB RAGU</li>
      <li>rosemary 2 handfuls, leaves picked</li>
      <li>garlic 2 cloves, peeled</li>
      <li>anchovy fillets in olive oil 4</li>
      <li>condimento morbido or white balsamic vinegar 150ml</li>
      <li>lamb neck on the bone 1kg</li>
      <li>plain flour 2 tbsp</li>
      <li>vegetable oil 3 tbsp</li>
      <li>white wine a splash</li>
      <li>chicken stock 500ml</li>
      <li>extra-virgin olive oil 3 tbsp</ol></strong></p>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <p><em>STEP 1
          Put the 00 flour in a mound on a clean worksurface, make a well in the centre and sprinkle in the salt. Add the eggs and yolks, then use your fingers in a swirling motion to incorporate the eggs into the flour – it should form a crumb-like mixture. Bring this together using the palms of your hands to make a firm dough, then knead for 10 minutes until smooth. Wrap in clingfilm, then chill for at least 1 hour. Remove from the fridge 1 hour before use.<br>

          STEP 2
          Put the rosemary, garlic, anchovy fillets and vinegar into a food processor and blitz to a green sauce.<br>

          STEP 3
          Season the lamb neck well and dust with the flour. Heat the vegetable oil in a large casserole, brown the lamb neck all over until golden, then remove to a plate. Add the white wine to deglaze the pan and reduce until the liquid evaporates. Put the lamb neck back in along with the green sauce and top up with chicken stock to just cover. Bring to the boil, then turn down to the lowest heat and gently simmer for 3 hours.<br>

          STEP 4
          Put the pasta through a pasta machine – starting from the widest setting, to the penultimate setting – it should be the thickness of a 5p piece. Lightly dust a clean worksurface with flour and lay the pasta sheet out. Using a sharp knife, cut the pasta widthways into 3cm-wide ribbons. Dust lightly with flour and set aside.<br>

          STEP 5
          The lamb should now be falling off the bone. Remove from the pan and reduce the sauce until thickened. Use two forks to shred the meat, being wary of small bones, then tip the meat back into the sauce. Keep warm.<br>

          STEP 6
          Cook the papardelle in a large pan of boiling salted water for 2-3 minutes or until al dente. Use tongs to tip the pasta into the sauce, add the olive oil and enough pasta cooking water to coat, then serve.</p></em><br>
