  <h2>4 Keys to Unlock the Power of Your Mind</h2>
  <p>Take care to feed and stimulate your brain and you will expand your mind. The two are inextricably connected. We need to see the human brain and mind with wonder, awe and inspiration.

    The brain is the equivalent of a human supercomputer. It is more complicated than any computer mankind has ever made, and maximizing its ability is essential to becoming the success you want to be—because it controls who you are. It is the command center involved in and controlling absolutely everything you do, determining how you think, feel and act.

    Simply put: When your brain is working at peak performance, it allows you to be your best because it controls the rest.</p>
    <h2>1. Change your beliefs.</h2>
    <p>Many people do not believe that they can learn, master knowledge or become "smart." These are deeply held beliefs for many, and ultimately, if we do not believe it, we will not achieve it.

      So change your beliefs. It is up to you to do the work of changing your beliefs. And when you do, you will be opening up new worlds—literally! Feed your mind with information that will change your belief. The truth is that you have an amazing mind with a capacity for learning that is beyond your comprehension. You must believe this. And when you do, you will be unlocking the potential of your mind.</p>
      <h2>2. Get the right knowledge.</h2>
      <p>What keeps some people from learning is that they choose not to access or do not have access to knowledge. Knowledge comes from experiences, books, people and other "knowledge dispensers." We must tap into that knowledge.

        So get the right knowledge. Words if they are not true are meaningless. I hear children say, "I read it in a book." But is it true? Just because someone says it or writes it, doesn't mean it is true. As a learner, you want to get the right knowledge, not just information or opinions. It is your job to seek out information and knowledge and then test it and run it through your mind to see if it is true, and if it can be rightfully applied to your life in order to make it better and help you succeed. You need to weigh and measure what you learn in order to gain the right knowledge. And when you do, you will be unlocking the potential of your mind.</p>
        <h2>3. Become passionate about learning.</h2>
        <p>Some people simply do not have the desire to learn. They may be lazy, or they may not see the positive impact that learning would have on them. They have no passion inside that drives them to learn.

          So become passionate about learning. This will take some work, but the only way to do it is to begin learning about things that have an immediate impact in your life. When you learn about a new financial concept that helps you earn money or get out of debt, that will get you fired up. When you learn about how to interact with your family in a healthy way and your relationships get better, that will inspire you. Become passionate about learning. And when you do, you will be unlocking the potential of your mind.</p>
          <h2>4. Discipline yourself through the hard work of study.</h2>
          <p>Gaining knowledge is hard work and takes a lifetime to master. It is an ongoing discipline that is never complete.

            So discipline yourself through the hard work of study. Learning will take work. Until someone comes up with modules that can plug into your mind and give you instant access to knowledge, you are on your own, and that takes work. The process of learning is a long one. Yes, we can speed it up, but it is still a process of reading, listening, reviewing, repetition, applying the knowledge, experiencing the outcomes, readjusting, etc. Simply put, that takes time. Slowly but surely, when you discipline yourself, you gain knowledge and learn. And when you do, you will be unlocking the potential of your mind.

            Learning is possible, no matter what your age. You are never too young or too old. Your mind was created to learn and has a huge capacity to do so. This week, make a commitment to unlock the potential of your mind!</p>
            <h2>The Generic Section element</h2>
            <p>The HTML "section" element represents a standalone section — which doesn't have a more specific semantic element to represent it — contained within an HTML document. Typically, but not always, sections have a heading.

              As an example, a navigation menu should be wrapped in a "nav" element, but a list of search results and a map display and its controls don't have specific elements, and could be put inside a "section".</p>
              <h2>Footer Element</h2>
              <p>The "footer" tag defines a footer for a document or section.

                <p>A "footer" element should contain information about its containing element.

                  <h3>A "footer" element typically contains:</h3>

                  <p>sauthorship information</p>
                  <p>copyright information</p>
                  <p>contact information</p>
                  <p>sitemap</p>
                  <p>back to top links</p>
                  <p>related documents</p>
                  <p>You can have several"footer" elements in one document.</p>
